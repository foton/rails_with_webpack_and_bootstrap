# Ruby on Rails with Webpack(er) and Bootstrap for noobies

0) For work with Webpacker you have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
1.1) Create some directory and cd in it.
1.2) Run `bundler init` which will create `Gemfile`.
1.3) Insert `gem 'rails', '~> 5.1.3'` into `Gemfile`.
1.4) Run `bundle` to install rails gem.
1.5) Run `rails new myapp --webpack`. It wil create RoR app structure in folder `myapp` and then initialize Webpack(er) and download required NPM packs.
1.6) Go into `myapp` folder
1.7) Congratulations, you can run rails server by `bundle exec rails s`.
1.8) Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser and You will see 'Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!' page. Frankly, I do not know where it came from. Some magic.

2.1) Copy file `w3.....` to `myapp/public/index.html`.
2.3) If you refresh http://localhost:3000 you will see nice page with bootstrap allerts which fading on close. Something to work with.
2.4) Page (in source code) download `JQuery` (JS) and `Bootstrap` (JS + CSS) from net. I you stop your internet connection it will not be pretty anymore. BUT! With Webpacker it can!

3.1) `Webpacker` uses `Webpack`, which is package of Javascript (run by `Node.js`) to squash JS modules (aka packages) You need in your app, into one big JS file. In short. `Webpack` itself is undependent on RoR, `Webpacker` add support for it into Rails app. `Webpack(er)` can replace (or coexists with) Rails assets pipeline, which alos build big JS file from many.

4.1) Let's make page ugly permanently until we supply Bootstrap by Webpacker. Delete lines with `<link rel="stylesheet" ...` and `<script src= .....`.
4.2) Because files in `public` are not processed by Rails stack we have to create some structe inside Rails app.
4.3) run `rails g controller bootstrap index` in `myapp` folder
4.4) Restart rails server to take changes in routes.
4.5) Open http://localhost:3000/bootstrap/index. It is just template. Notice where you can find it.
4.6) Replace content of `app/views/bootstrap/index.html.erb` with whole `<div class="container">
 ....</div>` from `public/index.html`.
4.7) Now we have two ugly pages! But one of them is using whole Rails stack. If you open source code of `/bootstrap/index`, you will see, that there are plenty on JavaScript inclusions. Last one,`/assets/application.self-.....js` comming from Rails assets pipeline and is empty (comments only).

5.1) If we need Bootstrap from Webpack, we have to:
5.2) Add it's package to ours: run `bin/yarn add bootstrap` in `myapp` directory. This will add bootstrap line to `myapp/packages.json`, something like Gemfile for node.js/npm/yarn, and content of package (and it's dependencies) to `myapp/node_modules`.
5.3) Require it in our 'entry point' (see Webpack(er) documentation). By default it is file `myapp/javascript/packs/application.js`. Insert lines `import {} from 'bootstrap';` and  `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';` into it. Yes, we import CSS in JavaScript file!
5.4) Run Webpack in `myapp` directory: `bundle exec bin/webpack`. This will create file (by default) `myapp/public/packs/application-:hash:.js` and `myapp/public/packs/application-:hash:.css`.
5.5) Make Rails to load this file by adding `<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application' %>` and `<%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application' %>` into `myapp/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` after `<%= javascript_include_tag ... %>`.
5.6) If you open http://localhost:3000/bootstrap/index now, page is pretty again. But, no fading on alert close!

6.1) Bootstrap needs jQuery for it. Its dependency but it is not installed along (golden Bundler!).
We have to install it: `bin/yarn add jquery` and  `bin/yarn add popper` (it is mentioned at [Bootstrap page](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/webpack/)).
6.2) Now we have to "inject" 'jQuery' module as '$' or 'jQuery' into other modules with Webpack plugin `ProvidePlugin`. Insert this code into `myapp/config/webpack/environment.js` (shared between all others)
right before `module.exports = environment`:
```
const  webpack = require("webpack");
environment.plugins.set(
  'Provide Global Variables',
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
        $: 'jquery',
        jQuery: 'jquery',
        'window.jQuery': 'jquery',
        Popper: ['popper.js', 'default'],
  })
)

```
6.3) Run Webpack in `myapp` directory again: `bundle exec bin/webpack` and now the alerts can fade on close.

7.1) [OPTIONAL] Another BUT! If you open browser development console, You cannot use `$()` or `jQuery()`. They are not set as global variables (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/30766733/1223501). They are injected into modules at bundling time. To have `$()` in console You must expose it with `expose-loader`. Install it by `bin/yarn add expose-loader` and then add code below after `const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')` in `myapp/config/webpack/environment.js`:
```
environment.loaders.set(
    'expose jQuery object to global space',
    { test: require.resolve("jquery"), loader: "expose-loader?$!expose-loader?jQuery" }
)
```
7.2) Run Webpack in `myapp` directory again: `bundle exec bin/webpack` and now You will have access to `$()` in browser console (try `$().jquery`).


Why all this? You dn't have to use ruby gem for pure JavaScript stuff in your app and wait when maintainer annd new version of bootstrap. You don't have to insert tons of `<script>` in your page.
Webpack is used outside Ruby world too, so updates are more frequent.

But there is one con: If gem is half ruby, half JS it's code have to be bundled by Rails asset pipeline (into `myapp/public/assets/appilication-:hash:.js`. Webpack cannot see into gems so You cannot import JS from them.
If you want to take out all JavaScripts from Rails asset pipeline, you have to either extract JS part from gem into `myapp/javascript` (sub)folder and import it by relative path or try to find NPM package derived from gem. And add it by Yarn.

And one more thing. Webpack can bundle (and process) images, fonts, CSS and many other assest. For example You can set rule _For all PNG images smaller than 50 kB, stick them into page as Base64 encoded_. but that is another story.
